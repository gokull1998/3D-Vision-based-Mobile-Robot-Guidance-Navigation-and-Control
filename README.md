# 3D-Vision-based-Mobile-Robot-Guidance-Navigation-and-Control
15MH375L - Minor Project I (Course Project @SRMIST)
Implementation of autonomous guidance, navigation and control of DaNI robot using 3D vision data. Vision data is obtained using Microsoft Kinect and an occupancy grid of the obstacle-filled environment is created. Path planning is performed on this map to guide the robot to its destination using odometry and control.
